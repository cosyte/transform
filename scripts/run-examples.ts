/**
 * Runs every example under `examples/` against the BUILT package and exits non-zero if any fails.
 *
 * Each `examples/*.ts` file (depth 1; a name starting with `_` is skipped) imports the package by
 * its published name, `@cosyte/transform`, which Node resolves through this package's own
 * `exports` to the built files in `dist/`. So the examples exercise what a consumer installs, and
 * `pnpm build` has to run first. They also import `@cosyte/hl7` and `@cosyte/fhir`, the peer
 * dependencies, from this repository's own devDependencies.
 *
 * Each example asserts its own key output and exits non-zero on a mismatch. This runner also
 * requires the `<name>: ok` line each one prints last, so an example that stopped early without an
 * error still fails, and it refuses to pass when it found nothing to run, because a runner that ran
 * nothing proves nothing.
 *
 * File names are passed to `spawnSync` as argv, never through a shell.
 *
 *     pnpm build && pnpm examples
