# Changesets

This folder is managed by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Changesets drives
the **version bump**, the **publish**, and the **release section in `CHANGELOG.md`** for
`@cosyte/transform`: a release writes its own version heading there from the changesets it consumed.
So **the changeset summary is the changelog entry**. Write it there and do not hand-edit
`CHANGELOG.md`, whose sections above `## Released before this file was generated` are generated
output.

Add a changeset for every meaningful change:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

During pre-alpha, pick **patch**: that keeps the package on the `0.0.x` ladder until its first
alpha. See the cosyte version ladder in the meta-repo's `documentation/conventions.md`.
