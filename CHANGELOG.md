## [Unreleased]

The first pre-alpha release (`0.0.1`) will ship the initial public API surface. The package begins
its public history at `0.0.x`, per the cosyte version ladder (`0.0.x` until first alpha).

### Added

- **Phase 1 — the datatype foundation + the value-free diagnostic channel** (roadmap §Phase 1).
  `@cosyte/transform` is the HL7 v2 → FHIR R4 **transformation** tier (a consumer of `@cosyte/hl7` +
  `@cosyte/fhir`), not a parser. Every mapping is grounded firsthand on the published HL7 v2-to-FHIR
  Implementation Guide (`hl7.fhir.uv.v2mappings`, STU Edition 1) datatype/table ConceptMaps.
  - The six safety-critical datatype converters, each fail-safe and IG-grounded:
    `toFhirDateTime` (DTM/TS → `dateTime`; a timezone-less time is reduced to date precision, never a
    guessed UTC), `toFhirIdentifier` (CX → `Identifier`; the assigning authority resolves via a
    NamingSystem registry, **never** synthesized from HD.1 alone), `toFhirCodeableConcept` (CWE/CE →
    `CodeableConcept`; an unmapped code is preserved + flagged, never coerced),
    `toFhirHumanName` (XPN → `HumanName`; HL70200 → name-use), `toFhirAddress` (XAD → `Address`; the
    value-conditional XAD.7 split over HL70190 → address-use/type), `toFhirQuantity` (NM + units →
    `Quantity`; magnitude carried precision-exact, non-UCUM unit preserved verbatim, never converted).
  - The `OperationOutcome`-shaped, **value-free** diagnostic channel: `TransformIssue`, the stable
    `ISSUE_CODES` + `FATAL_CODES` registries (`key === value`; renaming/removing one is breaking),
    the `issue` factory, and `toOperationOutcome(issues)`.
  - The minimal NamingSystem resolver: `createNamingSystem`, `DEFAULT_V2_CODE_SYSTEMS`,
    `V2_0203_SYSTEM` — HD → `Identifier.system` (safe OID/UUID auto-derivation only) and v2 Table 0396
    mnemonic → canonical URI (FHIR-core-fixed systems only; full THO crosswalk deferred to Phase 6).
  - Property + fuzz coverage over the datatype boundary (never-throw, registered value-free issues,
    and an emit gate against `@cosyte/fhir.validateResource`).
- **`@cosyte/hl7` + `@cosyte/fhir` as peer dependencies**, consumed as vendored `pnpm pack` tarballs
  in `vendor/` for dev/test (ADR 0001 + umbrella ADR 0008), with `scripts/vendor-refresh.sh`. Pinned
  sibling commits: `@cosyte/hl7` `46d50eb`, `@cosyte/fhir` `7a099b2`. **Third-party runtime deps: 0.**
- Two architecture ADRs (`documentation/decisions/`): `0001` — the transformation tier may depend on
  the parser tier; third-party runtime deps stay zero. `0002` — terminology is a separate
  `@cosyte/terminology` sibling; value translation is BYO-ConceptMap.

### Changed

- **Replaced the parser-template scaffold** with the transformation shape: removed the placeholder
  `parseTransform` / `WARNING_CODES` / `FATAL_CODES` parser stubs and the round-trip property test;
  rewrote `docs-content/`, `README`, and this repo's `CLAUDE.md` for the transformation library.
