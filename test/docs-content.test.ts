 * Doc/code-agreement gate. Every ```` ```ts runnable ```` block in `docs-content/` is extracted,
 * compiled, and executed, and its inline `// =>` assertions are checked — so a documented example can
 * never silently drift from the shipped code (the documentation analog of the conformance runners).
 *
 * `resolve` points a snippet's `import ... from "@cosyte/transform"` at this repo's source, the same way the
 * rest of the suite imports it — a fast local gate. To assert against the *built* artifact a consumer
 * installs, run `pnpm build` first and map the specifier to `../dist/index.js` instead.
