/**
 * Doc/code-agreement gate. Every ```` ```ts runnable ```` block in `docs-content/` is extracted,
 * compiled, and executed, and its inline `// =>` assertions are checked, so a documented example can
 * never silently drift from the shipped code (the documentation analog of the conformance runners).
 *
 * Snippets import the package the way a consumer does: against the **built** ESM artifact, not the
 * source tree. The harness executes each block as a standalone ES module, so it can't resolve the
 * source's internal `.js`→`.ts` imports; the bundled `dist/index.mjs` is self-contained and is also
 * exactly what an installer loads. The shared CI gate runs `test` before `build`, so we provision
 * `dist/` on demand here rather than assuming build order.
