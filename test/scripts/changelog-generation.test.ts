/**
 * Tests for the CHANGELOG generation contract: `.changeset/config.json` plus the
 * shape of `CHANGELOG.md` that makes generated output land where a reader expects
 * it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `CHANGELOG.md` is listed in `package.json#files`, so it is
 * inside every published tarball of this package. For the whole of its published
 * history the release wrote no version heading into it, because
 * `.changeset/config.json` set `"changelog": false`. The file was hand-maintained
 * under one `[Unreleased]` heading that nothing ever rolled over, and its preamble
 * promised that a first pre-alpha release "will ship" the API surface listed below
 * it, in a tarball that had already shipped that surface several versions earlier.
 * That is not a typo to correct by hand: correcting the prose leaves the mechanism
 * that wrote it, and it drifts again on the next release. The flag is what these
 * tests hold down.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST PINS, AND WHY IT IS HERE:
 *
 *  1. The flag itself. `changelog` must name a generator that really resolves and
 *     really exports the two functions Changesets calls. `false` is a legal value
 *     that silently produces no version heading at all, which is the state this
 *     work replaced.
 *  2. That the release actually reaches the generator. The `version` script is a
 *     chain, and `changeset version` is the only link in it that writes a
 *     changelog. A future edit that reorders or drops that link turns the flag into
 *     decoration with nothing else going red.
 *  3. THE DEFECT, ASSERTED DIRECTLY: no `[Unreleased]` heading and no
 *     `[Unreleased]` link definition survive in the file, and its preamble makes no
 *     future-tense promise about a release. With generation on, a surviving
 *     hand-maintained `[Unreleased]` heading is worse than before, not better: the
 *     generated version section is prepended ABOVE it, leaving already released
 *     content sitting under "Unreleased" forever, in the tarball.
 *  4. That the file is still shipped. If it ever leaves `files`, the assertions
 *     above are still nice to have but stop being about a consumer-visible defect,
 *     and the next reader deserves to be told which it is.
 *  5. END TO END, AGAINST THE REAL TOOL. This repo's real `CHANGELOG.md` and real
 *     `.changeset/config.json` are copied into a throwaway package, a synthetic
 *     changeset is added, and the real `changeset version` is run. A test that
 *     reimplements where Changesets inserts text proves only that the test agrees
 *     with itself, and would keep passing through the upgrade that moved it. The
 *     released document must satisfy the shape rule TOO, and the archived history
 *     must come through byte identical: a rule that only held before the first
 *     release would wedge this repo the first time this configuration worked. The
 *     throwaway package is a real git repo, which is not tidiness: the default
 *     generator prefixes each entry with the short sha of the commit that added the
 *     changeset, so without history every case here would assert against a line
 *     shape (`- <summary>`) that no release actually writes.
 *  6. THE PREFIX COLLISION, ON THIS PACKAGE'S OWN LADDER. `## 0.0.1` is a prefix of
 *     `## 0.0.10`, and this package is already past `0.0.6`, so it reaches that pair
 *     within a handful of releases. Any check written with `String.indexOf` or a
 *     substring `toContain` over a version heading reports a heading the document
 *     does not have. The case proves it rather than asserting it: on a document
 *     whose only version heading is `## 0.0.10`, a substring search for `## 0.0.1`
 *     returns TRUE while the exact heading list correctly does not contain it. Every
 *     version-heading comparison in this file is an exact match against that list
 *     for that reason.
 *  7. A CONTROL PROVING THE FLAG IS LOAD-BEARING. The same inputs with
 *     `"changelog": false` must produce NO version heading and leave the document
 *     byte identical. Without this, case 5 would pass on a config change that did
 *     nothing.
 *  8. A CONTROL PROVING THE ENTRY IS THIS PACKAGE'S. A changeset naming a DIFFERENT
 *     package must not write an entry into this package's changelog. Cases 5 and 6
 *     would both pass on a generator that wrote every changeset it found into every
 *     changelog it could reach, and "the changeset summary is the changelog entry"
 *     is only worth anything if the changelog is the right package's.
 *  9. THE PRETTIER PASS IS LEFT ON HERE, AND THAT IS DERIVED FROM THIS REPO RATHER
 *     THAN COPIED FROM A SIBLING. Changesets runs the document it writes through
 *     Prettier unless `"prettier": false` turns the pass off, and the right answer
 *     differs per repo. THIS REPO HAS NO `.prettierignore` AT ALL AND ITS
 *     `format:check` GLOBS `"*.{json,md,yml}"`, so `CHANGELOG.md` is inside this
 *     repo's own formatting gate and its archived history is already
 *     Prettier-canonical. Both arms were measured here, and the measurement does NOT
 *     land where a sibling's did:
 *
 *       - WITH THE PASS ON, the archived history comes through a release BYTE
 *         IDENTICAL. That is the arm that matters, because a sibling whose
 *         `.prettierignore` lists `*.md` had a history that was never
 *         Prettier-canonical, and leaving the pass on there rewrote around 1,240
 *         lines of already-published text and ate the spaces around a backticked
 *         literal inside a bold span. Text corruption inside a permanent tarball is
 *         not a formatting preference. Measured on this repo: zero bytes move.
 *       - WITH THE PASS OFF, the generator's raw output is NOT Prettier-canonical
 *         even for the simplest possible summary: it writes `## <version>` and
 *         `### Patch Changes` on adjacent lines with no blank line between them, and
 *         this repo's own `format:check` rejects that document.
 *
 *     AND THE HONEST QUALIFIER, MEASURED RATHER THAN INHERITED. Unlike the sibling
 *     this shape came from, THIS repo's `version` script runs its own
 *     `prettier --write` over `CHANGELOG.md` as a later link in the chain, so with
 *     the pass off that second pass would repair the raw output and the Version PR
 *     would NOT open red. Measured: the repaired document is byte-for-byte the
 *     document the pass-on arm produces, modulo the changeset commit's sha. So the
 *     reason to leave the pass ON here is NOT "otherwise CI reds". It is that with
 *     the pass off, a canonical published changelog rests entirely on `CHANGELOG.md`
 *     staying inside that one `prettier --write` argument list, which nothing pins
 *     and which the nearest sibling repo does not even have; and that with the pass
 *     on it costs nothing, because the archive is byte identical either way. DO NOT
 *     RESYNC THIS VALUE BETWEEN REPOS. Derive it from the repo in front of you, and
 *     re-measure both arms if the `version` script changes.
 * 10. THE SHAPE RULE, and the negative control that explains it. Changesets prepends
 *     by replacing the FIRST newline in the file, so exactly one line can sit above
 *     generated output. The rule is that NOTHING BUT THE H1 sits above the first
 *     heading, which is what makes the splice land between two headings instead of
 *     cutting a paragraph in half. It is deliberately not "the archive heading comes
 *     second": a release puts its own version heading there, so that assertion would
 *     wedge the first Version PR this configuration ever opens. The control
 *     reproduces the damage on the shape this file used to have, so the rule is
 *     demonstrated rather than asserted.
 *
 * Every case runs in a temp directory built from scratch, and every mutation happens
 * there: nothing here writes into the repo, bumps its version, or consumes a real
 * changeset. Unlike `test/scripts/phi-scan.test.ts`, whose temp trees have to sit
 * under `test/` because the walk root is what that file proves, these trees belong in
 * the OS temp directory: they contain a `CHANGELOG.md` and a throwaway `package.json`
 * and have nothing to say to the PHI walk roots.
 *
 * The temp tree links this repo's Prettier and its Prettier config in, and that is
 * load-bearing rather than tidy: Changesets resolves Prettier from the tree it is
 * writing into and falls back to its own bundled copy when it finds none, so a run
 * without the links would exercise a formatter and a config that no release of this
 * package has ever used, and case 9 would prove nothing about what really lands on a
 * Version PR.
 *
 * MEASURED WHILE BUILDING THIS, AND WORTH KNOWING BEFORE DEBUGGING A RELEASE:
 * Changesets wraps the changelog write in a try/catch that only `console.warn`s. A
 * tree where `package.json` declares a Prettier config that cannot be resolved bumps
 * the version, consumes the changeset, and writes NO changelog at all, with a warning
 * as the only signal. WHATEVER THE CAUSE, A RELEASE THAT PUBLISHES WITH AN UNCHANGED
 * CHANGELOG IS A WRITE FAILURE, NOT A FLAG THAT QUIETLY REVERTED.
 *
 * SECURITY: every subprocess call uses spawnSync with array args. No exec, no
 * shell-form.
